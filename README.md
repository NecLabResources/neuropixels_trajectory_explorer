# Neuropixels trajectory explorer
Neuropixels trajectory explorer with the Allen CCF mouse atlas 

There is also a Waxholm rat atlas version available, though this is not actively maintained.

The program does not require any specific software. It was written and can be run from MATLAB, but included is a standalone version that does not require MATLAB to run.

**Features:**
  * Plan trajectories to target brain regions with one or more Neuropixels probes
  * Interface with New Scale manipulators to have a live visual of trajectories and recorded areas during an experiment
  * Display brain regions alongside data during recording (in Open Ephys or SpikeGLX)
